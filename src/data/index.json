Inganathi is a determined, efficient, detail-orientated and respectfull player. She has an excellent rapport with people of all ages I know that because of how she treats people that have joined the team after her.Inganathi can communicate very well with others and she takes her job seriously with no disruption. In summary, I highly recommend Inganathi for any position that she may seek to pursue as she will be a valuable asset."
